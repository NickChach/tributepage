          A long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here were hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road. All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon in the middle of the road and he said:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
          <em>Design the best website in the world or I'll eat your soul.</em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
          Well, me and Kyle looked at each other and we each said "Okay", and we designed the first thing that came to our heads. Just so happened to be the best website in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
          Look into my eyes and it's easy to see. One and one make two, two and one make three. It was destiny. Once every hundred-thousand years or so, when the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow, and the grass doth grow.
          </p>
          <p>
          Needless to say, the beast was stunned. A whip-crack went his whippy tail and the beast was done. He asked us, "Be you angels?", and we said, "Nay! We are but men!".
          </p>
          <p>
          This is not the greatest website in the world, no. This is just a tribute. We couldn't remember the greatest website in the world, no. No, this is a tribute to the greatest website in the world. It was the greatest website in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
          And the peculiar thing is this, my friends. The website we designed on that fateful night didn't actually looked anything like this one.
          </p>
          <p>
          This is just a tribute. You've got to believe me and I wish you were there.
